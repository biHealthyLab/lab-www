<p><strong>This is two-week scientific meeting organized by the bHealthyAge Lab and the CRM (Centre de Recherches Mathématiques). All the presentations will take place at CRM (Université de Montréal).</strong></p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The brain contains 100 billions neurons and while original study of function focused on local coupling and function, a consensus has been reached that connectivity, graphs and networks are critical to understand brain function. Recent progress in network science to model and analyze the dynamics of the brain has been crucial to simulate brain functional connectivity and to predict network states.</p>
<p>While network models have been studied as independent systems, efforts in neuroscience in recent years has been put towards inferring networks of the brain from imaging data. Using probabilistic methods and inverse models, recurrent networks across populations and their change with disease have been characterized based on input from electrophysiological and functional imaging.</p>
<p>This sub-theme will cover the notions of network dynamics, discuss conceptual frameworks to model brain network topology and provide the latest progress in neural network inference from imaging data and associated methodological approaches at modeling networks of the brain.</p>
