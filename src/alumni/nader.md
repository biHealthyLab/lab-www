### Education

 Dr. Nader Riyahi Alam received his BSc degree in Nuclear Physics in 1986 from Shiraz University,  Shiraz-Iran, and his MSc and Ph.D. degrees in Medical Physics with a specialty in Medical Imaging from Nagoya University of Japan, in 1992 and 1996, respectively. His research interests have been in Neuroimaging and Magnetic Resonance Molecular Imaging (MRMI), leading to the development of fMRI compatible interface devices used in BCI, and  “the free metal-based natural metabolic contrast agents for detection of Glioblastoma Multiform (GBM) brain tumors”, and several “Theranostic Biomarkers for the detection of lymph and sentinel node of breast cancer”, using the last state of the art of  MTI, DWI, PWI and QSWI methods. Moreover, regarding Neuroimaging, Dr. Riyahi Alam, has been developing Functional & Cognitive Brain mapping algorithms using task-dependent, resting-fMRI, fNIRS for differentiating MS and NMO patients, and recently, studying rTMS efficacy for low back pain therapy.
