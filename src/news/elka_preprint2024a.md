### Abstract

The brain's synaptic network, characterized by parallel connections and feedback loops, drives information flow between neurons through a large system with infinitely many degrees of freedom. This system is best modeled by the graph Câˆ—-algebra of the underlying directed graph, the Toeplitz-Cuntz-Krieger algebra, which captures the diversity of potential information pathways. Coupled with the gauge action, this graph algebra defines an {\em algebraic quantum system}, and here we demonstrate that its thermodynamic properties provide a natural framework for describing the dynamic mappings of information flow within the network. Specifically, we show that the KMS states of this system yield global statistical measures of neuronal interactions, with computational illustrations based on the {\em C. elegans} synaptic network.
