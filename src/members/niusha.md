She is currently pursuing her MSc. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Concordia University, Montreal, QC, Canada, under the supervision of Professor Benali. Her current research is mainly focused on the early detection of Alzheimer’s disease using speech and language impairment.


### Educational Background 


She received her bachelor’s degree in Computer engineering as the third best student at Kermanshah University of Technology in 2018. 

As her B.S. thesis she:

- Designed and synthesized digital circuits for a biological neuron model and CPG 
- Proposed an efficient digital architecture for a biological neuron model
- Employed Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL) to design the digital architecture
- Simulated the design using Modalism software
- Compiled and synthesized the design using Quartus Prime Altera compiler


### Professional background

After her graduation she worked as a microcontroller programmer and developer in Rasa Zagros company for 2 years.
