presentation: |
  Dr. Moutuou's research interests focus on the mathematical foundations of Network Neuroscience. He has used concepts from Algebraic Topology, Spectral Theory, and Complex Systems to develop a novel mathematical framework and computational tools for analysing the topology and dynamics of the anatomo-functional networks of the human brain activities.
