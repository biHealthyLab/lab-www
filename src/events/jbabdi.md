### Abstract

Modulating the sample or the experiment has been a key (and obvious) approach in NMR for
decades. It is also a foundational concept for the hugely successfully fMRI and dMRI
techniques. The bountiful SNR of ultra-high field systems have allowed the development of
equivalent MRS techniques: functional and diffusion weighted MRS. However, analysis tools
for these techniques have been lacking, especially those which integrate the experimental
model. In this talk we will introduce a new MRS toolbox, FSL-MRS, and show how it can be
used to analyse the cutting edge of MRS acquisitions, as well as more traditional data.

### Biographies

##### Dr William Clarke

Dr William Clarke is a Wellcome Career Development Fellow at the University of Oxford.
He and his group specialise in developing novel acquisition and analysis tools for MR
spectroscopy of the human brain. Having trained in cardiac phosphorus spectroscopy,
and spent time working in ultra-high field neuroimaging, he brings experience from a wide
range of MRI systems and applications. He often uses it to help clinical and basic science
researchers use cutting-edge MRS methods for their own research.


##### Prof Saad Jbabdi

Prof Jbabdi is a Wellcome Senior Research Fellow at the University of Oxford, and a Senior
Research Fellow at St Hildaâ€™s College, Oxford. He trained in Engineering and Applied
Mathematics at Ecole Centrale Paris, where he also obtained his PhD in 2006. He has
wide ranging contributions to research in imaging methodology development, particularly
in diffusion MRI, functional MRI, and spectroscopy.
