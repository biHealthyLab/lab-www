### Introduction


Shima Panahi completed her M.A.Sc. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Concordia University. She worked as a graduate research assistant under the supervision of Dr. Habib Benali, the Canada Research Chair in Biomedical Imaging and Healthy Aging. She was selected in September 2021 to lead the development of an end-to-end data science workflow at PERFORM Center.


Her graduate studies were supported by competitive awards from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), and Concordia University internal scholarships. She contributed to the study funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR).


She was responsible for building a pipeline for preprocessing and analyzing datasets related to a novel multimodal neuroimaging study, as well as testing and implementing the 42-hour data collection protocol for this study which involved collecting synchronized EEG-fMRI, MRS, and polysomnography data from multiple human subjects during one sleep-wake cycle.
Through statistical analysis and linear modeling, she investigated the existence of a correlation between neural electrophysiology and biochemical activity across one sleepâ€“wake cycle, as measured by EEG and MRS under different conditions.

### Educational and Professional Background


As part of her work on remote health monitoring systems at the Science and Research Branch of Azad University, she developed signal processing and machine learning algorithms for biometric authentication using physiological signals. Notably, she proposed a novel signal segmentation algorithm that significantly improved classification accuracy. Her work was published at the International Conference on Computer and Knowledge Engineering (ICCKE).

At the University of Tehran, she contributed to the fNIRS research team, focusing on software development and circuit board analysis for fNIRS system design.


Shima was ranked as the top student during her B.Sc. studies in Medical Engineering-Bioelectric. For her undergraduate thesis, she developed a device for monitoring heart rate variability.
