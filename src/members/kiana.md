### Introduction

Kiana Ezzatdoost is a MASc student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Concordia University under the supervision of Dr. Habib Benali. Her research revolves around investigating the brain’s various functionality patterns by processing biological signals. Kiana is currently analyzing Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) and Electroencephalography (EEG) signals to trace short-term memory via the metabolism in a circadian rhythm, particularly glutamate level variation, following a motor sequence learning task. In addition to biological signal processing, her other areas of interest comprise mathematical modelling and artificial intelligence.


### Educational background

Kiana has pursued her undergraduate studies at Sharif University of Technology. In 2018, she joined the Augmented Intelligence Research lab (AIRLab), where she conducted several research projects on the human olfactory system. Her projects included building a portable olfactometer, developing a nonlinear EEG classifier and examining the olfactory response as a biomarker for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD).
Kiana currently holds the Recruitment Scholarship from Quebec Bio-Imaging Network, the In-course award and the Split Merit Scholarship from Concordia University, and two parts of an NSERC award.
