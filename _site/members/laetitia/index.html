<h4>In a nutshell</h4>
<p>Laetitia Jeancolas is currently a postdoctoral researcher at Paris Brain Institute (ICM). There, she has worked for a year on early Parkinson's disease (PD) detection using voice analysis and has studied the neural correlates of the related voice impairments. She has started this work during her PhD, which was awarded &quot;Best PhD&quot; of the Futur&amp;Ruptures Program by the Fondation Mines Télécom. Her research interests are wide-ranging around the use of signal processing and neuroimaging techniques for the early detection of neurodegenerative diseases and the understanding of their mechanisms. She will join Professor Habib Benali's research team at Concordia University, this summer, in order to develop a multimodal predictive model for Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<h4>Educational Background</h4>
<p>Laetitia Jeancolas is a former student of Ecole Normale Supérieure where she attended a selective program in fundamental physics and received a Master of Science degree in cognitive science. She obtained her PhD in signal processing at Télécom SudParis (Paris-Saclay University), in collaboration with Paris Brain Institute, and received several awards for her work.</p>
<h4>Professional background</h4>
<p>During her studies, she worked on several research projects, such as the development of a cognition model in the University of Arizona (USA), or the study of the tool use acquisition in infants, at Laboratoire Psychologie de la Perception (Paris V). Eventually, she was involved in a project on brain functional connectivity in early stages of Alzheimer's disease during memory tasks, at Paris Brain Institute and Grenoble Institut des Neurosciences (GIN). During her PhD, Laetitia Jeancolas worked on the early detection of Parkinson's disease using voice analysis and the correlations with neuroimaging. She designed the experimental protocol, set up the acquisition tools, collected the data and conducted the analyses. Laetitia also implemented face recordings in order to analyze PD hypomimia, and designed a task based functional MRI protocol that will enable the investigation of the neural disruptions causing the early PD speech impairments. Laetitia also gave classes of informatics to master students, and supervised three M.S. thesis and several M.S. research projects.</p>
<h4>Other Curriculum</h4>
<p>Laetitia also enjoyed volunteering in other than academic domains. She handled mistreated wild animals in Amazonia in a rehabilitation animal shelter, gave many remedial courses to underprivileged students, led activities in an association for mentally challenged persons, has been a scout supervisor and a hospital worker.</p>
