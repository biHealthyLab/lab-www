### Introduction

Milad is currently a master’s student in electrical engineering program at Concordia University. He joined the lab in 2019 and since then he has been working on mathematical modeling of lactate metabolism in the brain. Particularly, his work includes developing a system of ordinary differential equations for exploring lactate dynamics, as a possible energy fuel, in the interface of neurons, astrocytes, extracellular space and capillaries and analyzing it in resting and activation. 

### Educational background

 Milad completed his B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering (communications) at the University of Tehran in 2018. In his thesis, he investigated the possibility of predicting epileptic seizures by processing and classification of EEG signals based on their dynamical chaotic properties.

### Other curriculum

 Milad has been a member of the PERFORM student scientific event sub-committee since 2020.
