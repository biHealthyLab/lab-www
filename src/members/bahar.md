### A brief introduction


I am a MASc student under the supervision of Dr. Habib Benali. My research focuses on analyzing resting-state fMRI data to investigate the relationship between brain glutamate levels and motor-related neural activity patterns. By integrating multimodal neuroimaging data, I aim to explore how fluctuations in glutamate concentration are reflected in BOLD signal dynamics, particularly in brain regions involved in motor memory consolidation.


### Educational background
 

I completed my Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering at Shahid Beheshti University in Tehran. I was involved in research at the Robotics and Intelligent Automation Lab and SBU EEG Recording Lab, where I gained skills in computer vision, machine learning, and bio-signal processing.


### Research


My current research involves preprocessing and analyzing resting-state fMRI data collected during a multimodal study that includes EEG and MRS. I focus on extracting meaningful neural patterns from BOLD signals and investigating their relationship with glutamate concentration in key brain regions such as the supplementary motor area (SMA) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). This work is part of a broader effort to understand the neural and metabolic mechanisms that support motor memory formation and consolidation across the sleep-wake cycle.
