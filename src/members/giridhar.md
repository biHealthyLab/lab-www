### Research

Understanding the foundational principles of neural communication remains a grand challenge in neuroscience, particularly when it comes to disentangling the multiplexed signaling strategies employed by biological systems. Caenorhabditis elegans, a model organism with a fully mapped synaptic connectome, also exhibits a parallel mode of information transmission through extrasynaptic signaling—facilitated by neuropeptides and monoamines—that is not constrained by direct anatomical connections. Despite its simplicity in neuronal count, the worm leverages this dual signaling architecture to coordinate a broad repertoire of behaviors. In this work, we aim to explore the functional interplay between the synaptic (wired) and extrasynaptic (wireless) connectomes. In the first phase, we segment the extrasynaptic connectome using Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) states to classify and analyze the dependence of extrasynaptic circuits on synaptic topology. In the second phase, we employ topological data analysis—specifically persistent homology and clustering techniques—to extract higher-order structures and functional motifs embedded within these neural networks. By integrating graph-theoretic and topological tools, our objective is to elucidate how C. elegans exploits extrasynaptic communication to compensate for anatomical limitations, providing insights into the design principles of robust, adaptable neural systems.
