<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Imaging technologies are allowing neuroscientists to gain critical
insights into the neural networks mediating a variety of cognitive
processes. In this talk, I will review studies looking at the intricate
relationship between the structure and function of brain networks.
First, I will describe how the anatomical organization of the brain
influences the patterns of static and dynamic functional interactions
using MRI data. Then, I will expose the structural underpinnings of
intrinsic coupling modes in the cerebral cortex using
electrophysiological data. This research focuses on understanding how
the structural connectivity within the cortex leads to the emergence of
specific phase and envelope coupling patterns. These observations shed
light on the complex interplay between the physical structure of the
brain and its dynamic processes, demonstrating that brain function,
mediated by neural networks, is intimately related to the anatomical
scaffold.</p>
<h3>Short Bio</h3>
<p>Arnaud studied computer science at Polytech’Orléans, France, where he
received an engineer diploma in 2006. Then, he did a master of science
in medical imaging at Paris 12 University in 2007, where he got
interested by neurosciences. In 2007-2010, Arnaud was a PhD student
between the LIF in Paris (under the supervision of Habib Benali) and the
INRIA in Sophia-Antipolis (under the supervision of Rachid Deriche).
This is where he started to look at the relationship between brain
structure and function. Between 2011 and 2013, Arnaud was a
post-doctoral fellow at the LIB and also research engineer at the Brain
and Spine Institute, where he provided expertise in MRI technics and
analysis. From 2014, he is a post-doctoral fellow at the University
Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf in Hamburg, Germany. Where he continues
to develop ideas on computational analysis and modeling of brain network
connectivity and dynamics.</p>
