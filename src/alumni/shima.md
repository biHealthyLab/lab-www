### Introduction

Shima was a graduate research assistant (MASc.) at Biomedical Healthy Aging Lab. She joined the Lab
in September 2021 to work on a multimodal approach for investigating motor skill learning (MSL) induced plasticity in the human brain. In this study, the relationship between MSL, spatiotemporal
patterns of neural activity, and glutamate (the main excitatory transmitter in the central nervous
system) activity is assessed across at least one sleep-wake cycle.
Accordingly, we acquire bimodal EEG-MRS and EEG-fMRI data to establish regional relationships
between glutamate concentrations as captured by MRS and changes in neural activity as captured by
EEG and fMRI.

Shima was responsible for data acquisition as a protocol coordinator and data analysis of EEG-MRS where
she will quantify the temporal dynamics of cortical glutamate associated with sleep-dependent
consolidation of newly acquired motor memories during the first night of sleep following MSL, so as to
correlate glutamate dynamics to whole-brain network dynamics across sleep stages.
