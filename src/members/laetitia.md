### Introduction

Laetitia Jeancolas is currently a postdoctoral fellow at Concordia University. Her main project, done in collaboration with Paris Brain Institute (ICM) and IM2A, focuses on multimodal predictive modeling of Alzheimer’s disease (INSIGHT cohort). Specifically, Laetitia studies the neurovascular coupling in participants with subjective memory loss. She is also specialized in the analysis of voice impairments in neurodegenerative diseases and their use for automatic and early detection and disease monitoring. Her research interests are wide-ranging, centering around the use of signal processing, machine learning and neuroimaging techniques for the early detection of neurodegenerative diseases and the understanding of their mechanisms.

### Educational Background

Laetitia Jeancolas is a former student of Ecole Normale Supérieure where she attended a selective program in fundamental physics and received a Master of Science degree in cognitive science. In 2019, she obtained her PhD in signal processing at Télécom SudParis (Paris-Saclay University), in collaboration with ICM. She received the *Best PhD award* of the Futur & Ruptures Program by the Fondation Mines Télécom, along with several other awards during her PhD.

### Professional background

During her studies, Laetitia Jeancolas worked on several research projects, such as the development of a cognition model in the University of Arizona (USA), or the study of tool use acquisition in infants, at Integrative Neuroscience and Cognition Center (former Laboratoire Psychologie de la Perception, Paris V). She did her M.S research project on brain effective connectivity in early stages of Alzheimer's disease during memory tasks, at ICM and Grenoble Institut des Neurosciences (GIN).

During her PhD, Laetitia Jeancolas worked on the early detection of Parkinson's disease (PD) using voice analysis. She designed the experimental protocol, set up the acquisition tools, collected the data and conducted the analyses. One of the main innovative analyses consisted in adapting a recent deep learning feature extraction technique used in speaker recognition to PD detection. Laetitia also implemented face recordings, to analyze PD hypomimia in the same cohort, as well as a task based functional MRI protocol that enables the investigation of the neural disruptions causing the early PD speech impairments.

She expanded her PhD work during a postdoc at ICM where she focused more precisely on the neural correlates of the Parkinson-related voice impairments.
Since, she has continued to work in this field through several collaborations with ICM, Télécom SudParis, Lille university, McGill university and Concordia university, supervising several PhD students, and M.S. research projects, on Parkinson and Alzheimer’s speech impairments and PD hypomimia.
