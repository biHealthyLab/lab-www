The main goal of our multidisciplinary research is to better understand **brain activity in healthy aging** and to shed light on factors predicting conversion to **neurodegenerative disease**. 

Indeed, understanding neuronal activity, brain metabolism and patho-physiological process will enable the development of innovative mathematical models (non-linear ordinary differential equation system) by combining biological and biomedical images from the basic modelling of the brain's anatomo-functional circuits to models of tau protein accumulation (partial differential equation formalism). In such “virtual brain activity and pathology” environment, the outcome of brain disease development for individual subjects can be foreseen by simulations. 

Numerical simulation tools would allow prediction of the progress of the disease as well as an understanding of its causes, which remain uncertain. This numerical approach is a new paradigm of the study of the patho-physiological process in healthy aging of subjects at-risk for neurodegenerative disease. This approach, referred to as “**predictive physiopathology**”, offer better health through prevention.
